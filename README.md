# ToDoList-v2

This is the second version of TodoList App.
Now when you add a new item in the list and run the server again then your item remains in the list.
I have connected this app to Mongodb database which lets the user to see its added items in the list even if he/she runs the server again.

Steps and installation

1. Download the zip file and store it in a desired location.
2. Open command prompt and locate to the location where you have unzipped the "ToDolistMain" folder.

   Example

   ```
   cd desktop/
   C:\Users\HP\desktop> cd ToDolistMain
   C:\Users\HP\desktop\ToDolistMain>
   ```

3. Now intialize mpn package using below command:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

   This will install npm module in the project.

  
4. Now open your web browser and type: "localhost:3000".This will run your project.
